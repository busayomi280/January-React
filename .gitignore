Step 1: Verify Your Route is Set Up

Check your backend routes file (usually blogRoutes.js or similar)
Make sure you have a route like: router.get('/blogs/:id', getSingleBlog)
Test the endpoint in Postman or your browser: http://localhost:3000/api/v1/blogs/SOME_BLOG_ID

Step 2: Create the Custom Hook (useSingleBlog.js)
Create a new file in your hooks folder with:

Import useState, useEffect from React
Import useParams from react-router-dom
Import axios
Create state for: blog, loading, error
Get the id from URL params using useParams()
In useEffect, fetch the blog data using the ID
Make the API call to: http://localhost:3000/api/v1/blogs/${id}
Handle the response (note: your backend returns {blog: {...}} so you'll need res.data.blog)
Set loading to true before fetch, false after
Handle any errors in a catch block
Return { blog, loading, error } from the hook

Step 3: Create the Single Blog Component (BlogDetails.jsx)

Create a new component file
Import and use your useSingleBlog hook
Destructure { blog, loading, error }
Show a loading state while loading is true
Show an error message if error exists
Once loaded, display the blog data:

Cover image (if exists)
Title
Author
Category
Tags (map through the array)
Content
Published date (use createdAt or publishedAt)


Add a "Back to Blogs" button using useNavigate

Step 4: Set Up the Route

Go to your main routing file (probably App.jsx)
Add a new route: path should be /blogs/:id and element should be your BlogDetails component
Make sure it's inside your <Routes> component

Step 5: Update Your Blogs List Page

In your blogs list component (where you display all blogs)
Import Link from react-router-dom
Wrap each blog card/item with <Link to={/blogs/${blog._id}}>
Or add a "Read More" button that navigates to /blogs/${blog._id}

Step 6: Test

Run your application
Go to your blogs list page
Click on a blog
You should be taken to /blogs/BLOG_ID and see the full blog details
